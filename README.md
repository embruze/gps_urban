#GPS 

###Danny's Notes
I'd like to analyze multi-path error in the pickup/dropoff coordinates as it relates to building bulk density (urban canyon effect). This is somewhat related to my work. There is also fare data and tip data and temporal data so if multipath error isn't interesting there's def. some other uses for the data.

Basically, I'd like to use this data and the building bulk data to help predict error in GPS (in this case Taxi's rather than study subjects) as distance from nearest Roadbed and in the areal unit of Census Block. I can handle GIS processing but not savvy with statistical analysis.
